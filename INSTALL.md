# Install fswatch
brew install fswatch

# Install xbar (optional, for menu bar integration)
brew install --cask xbar
```

### Step 2: Configure SSH Access

```bash
# Generate SSH key if you don't have one
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Copy the public key to your server
ssh-copy-id username@your-server.com

# Test SSH connection
ssh username@your-server.com "echo 'SSH works!'"
```

### Step 3: Clone and Configure

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-screenshot-uploader.git
cd claude-screenshot-uploader

# Copy to your home directory
cp -r . ~/claude-screenshot-uploader/

# Create configuration from template
cp config.example.sh ~/.claude-screenshot-uploader.conf

# Edit configuration with your server details
nano ~/.claude-screenshot-uploader.conf
```

Edit the configuration file:
```bash
SERVER_HOST="your-server.com"        # Your server
SERVER_USER="your-username"          # SSH username
SERVER_PATH="/tmp/screenshots"       # Remote path
LOCAL_SCREENSHOTS="$HOME/Screenshots"
AUTO_DELETE="false"
```

### Step 4: Install the Service

```bash
# Copy LaunchAgent plist
cp com.claudecode.screenshot-uploader.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/

# Fix the script path in the plist
sed -i '' "s|~/claude-screenshot-uploader|$HOME/claude-screenshot-uploader|g" ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claudecode.screenshot-uploader.plist

# Load the service
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claudecode.screenshot-uploader.plist
```

### Step 5: Configure Screenshot Location

```bash
# Change macOS screenshot save location
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Screenshots

# Create the directory
mkdir -p ~/Screenshots

# Restart SystemUIServer to apply changes
killall SystemUIServer
```

### Step 6: Install xbar Plugin (Optional)

```bash
# Ensure xbar plugins directory exists
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/xbar/plugins/

# Copy the plugin
cp xbar/screenshot-uploader.1s.sh ~/Library/Application\ Support/xbar/plugins/

# Make executable
chmod +x ~/Library/Application\ Support/xbar/plugins/screenshot-uploader.1s.sh

# Restart xbar
killall xbar 2>/dev/null || true
open -a xbar
```

## Verification

### 1. Check Service Status

launchctl list | grep com.claudecode.screenshot-uploader

# Check logs
tail -f /tmp/screenshot-uploader.log
```

### 2. Test Screenshot Upload

1. Take a screenshot: `Cmd + Shift + 4`
2. Check it was saved to `~/Screenshots/`
3. Wait a moment for upload
4. Check your clipboard: `pbpaste`
5. Verify file exists on server:

   ssh username@server "ls -la /tmp/screenshots/"
   ```
